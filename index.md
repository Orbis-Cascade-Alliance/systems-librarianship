# {{ page.title }}

This is the homepage of the course.

## Adding Pages

Add and edit pages within the /_pages directory. [Example]({{ "page" | absolute_url}})

Set the titles, permalinks, and order in the frontmatter. (Between the lines of three dashes at the top.)

All pages will appear in the menu to the left. For example, the page with an order of 1 will appear first in the list, followed by the page with an order of 2, etc.

## Markdown

All pages are written in Markdown. See [Basic Syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)
